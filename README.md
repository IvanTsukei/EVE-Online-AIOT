I created this in about a week (totally didn't have 2 months to work on this of which I only used a week due to procrastination :sweat_smile:) and with it being one of my first larger projects in Python, I wanted to share it. I commented as much as possible and tried to break up the code into separate files, but the code is still certainly a bit messy. However, I think people who are just starting out with tkinter and pandas will find some use in looking over my work.

As a reminder:
* This is intended as a reference. If you copy this for a class, just keep in mind it can be flagged and you will likely receive a 0
* Yes, it's not the cleanest code but I did the best I could as someone new to programming 
* All images used were created by me in Photoshop. Please do not use them elsewhere nor copy their likeness
